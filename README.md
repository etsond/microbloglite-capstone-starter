### Interesting Piece of Code

Here is an interesting piece of code from the project that handles creating sorting posts:

```javascript
 .then(posts => {
                const sortOrder = sortOrderSelect.value;
                if (sortOrder === "oldest") {
                    posts.sort((a, b) => new Date(a.createdAt) - new Date(b.createdAt));
                } else {
                    posts.sort((a, b) => new Date(b.createdAt) - new Date(a.createdAt));
                }
                displayPosts(posts);
```

This part of the code allows users to choose how they want to see their posts, either from oldest to newest or newest to oldest, using a dropdown menu. It sorts the posts based on the selected option and then updates the page to display the posts in the chosen order. This make the user experience better by providing control over the display of content, making the app more user-friendly.
